# Central DAO Token

This repository contains the smart contract implementation of **Central DAO Token**, built during the **CoreDAO Workshop x Sage** event. The project demonstrates the creation and deployment of a custom ERC-20-like token using smart contract best practices.

---

## 🧾 Overview

**Central DAO Token** is a decentralized token built for learning and demonstration purposes, simulating how tokens are created, managed, and deployed on a blockchain using CoreDAO-compatible smart contracts.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Basic token creation with custom name and symbol
- ✅ Fixed supply configuration
- ✅ Owner control over minting/burning (if implemented)
- ✅ Deployment-ready smart contract code

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Solidity  
- **Framework**: Hardhat / Truffle (if used)  
- **Blockchain**: CoreDAO / EVM Compatible  
- **Package Manager**: npm  
- **Tools**: Metamask, Remix IDE (optional)
